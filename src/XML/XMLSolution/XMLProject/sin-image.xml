         vision?</h2>
               <p>Use the Amsler grid as often as
            your eye healthcare provider suggests. Keep the grid where youï¿½ll remember to use it.
            Call your eye healthcare provider right away if you notice any changes with your
            eyesight. This includes if your vision improves.</p>
